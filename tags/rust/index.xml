      <description>SSHniff: An SSH Metadata Analyser As part of my final-year bachelor research project, I took a stab at determining how feasible a metadata-based attack on the SSH protocol is nowadays. This type of attack was first introduced in 2001, in a paper called &amp;ldquo;Timing Analysis of Keystrokes and Timing Attacks on SSH&amp;rdquo;. It is based on the fact that interactive SSH sessions leak significant metadata. Keystrokes, while encrypted, are sent to and echoed by the server individually.</description>
