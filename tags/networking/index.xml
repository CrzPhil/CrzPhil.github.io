      <description>Introduction OpenSSH version 9.5 introduced measures to mitigate a keystroke timing attack via traffic analysis. The patch involved adding keystroke timing obfuscation to the SSH client. As per the release notes, this feature “attempts to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive traffic at fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when there is only a small amount of data being sent”. Additionally, fake chaff packets are sent after the last real keystroke, significantly complicating traffic analysis by shrouding the real keystrokes in a stream of impostors.</description>

      <description>SSHniff: An SSH Metadata Analyser As part of my final-year bachelor research project, I took a stab at determining how feasible a metadata-based attack on the SSH protocol is nowadays. This type of attack was first introduced in 2001, in a paper called &amp;ldquo;Timing Analysis of Keystrokes and Timing Attacks on SSH&amp;rdquo;. It is based on the fact that interactive SSH sessions leak significant metadata. Keystrokes, while encrypted, are sent to and echoed by the server individually.</description>
